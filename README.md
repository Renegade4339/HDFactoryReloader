# 7.76mm Reloading Device Mk. II
Loadout Code: `frd`
GZDoom Actor Name: `FactoryAutoReloader`

During the increased demand of factory-grade 7mm rounds, a small group of people decided to
break the limit by including the need of steel scraps as requirement to make the factory-grade
rounds within the already-unholy device. This broke records of amounts sold within a week. However, during the second week of
popularity, a plethora of lawsuits file against the people behind the device for violating
Volt's EULA, with one of them demanding the group to stop producing. If only Volt-UAC didn't
pull a Nintendo at them then it would've been alright.

Instructions: Identical to the standard reloader but it has an additional requirement of some steel scraps.
This should be obvious by now.
